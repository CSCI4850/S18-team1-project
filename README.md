<img src="https://github.com/CSCI4850/S18-team1-project/blob/master/breakout.gif" width="200px" height="auto">

### Model:
Our model consists of a Convolutional Neural Network with a preprocessed frame from Breakout of a (210, 160, 3) tuple => (84, 84) grayscale down-sized frame and a linear output size of 4 (no-op, fire, move left, move right) which gets reduced down to 3 (no-op, move left, move right) because (fire) in breakout is basically a no-op. The model uses the Adam optimizer with a logcosh, mean squared error, or huber loss function.

### Instructions:
To start the breakout game with the DQN Agent, run ```python3 breakout.py```
<br>
To change how the DQN Agent learns, modify hyperparameters.py

### Demo (located in demo):
The demo consists of a short python notebook under DQN_Testing.ipynb, it renders every 6 frames.
<br>
The other component is a python script that renders each frame as it plays with a specified weight.
