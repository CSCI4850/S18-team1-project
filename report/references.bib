	abstract={
                  Empirical evaluations play an important role in
                  machine learning. However, the usefulness of any
                  evaluation depends on the \emph{empirical
                  methodology} employed. Designing good empirical
                  methodologies is difficult in part because agents
                  can \emph{overfit} test evaluations and thereby
                  obtain misleadingly high scores. We argue that
                  reinforcement learning is particularly vulnerable to
                  \emph{environment overfitting} and propose as a
                  remedy \emph{generalized methodologies}, in which
                  evaluations are based on multiple environments
                  sampled from a distribution. In addition, we
                  consider how to summarize performance when scores
                  from different environments may not have
                  commensurate values. Finally, we present
                  proof-of-concept results demonstrating how these
                  methodologies can validate an intuitively useful
                  range-adaptive tile coding method.
