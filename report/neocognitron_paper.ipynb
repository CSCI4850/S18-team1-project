    "\\subsection*{Environment}\n",
    "We are using 'BreakoutDeterministic-v4' in Open AI Gym. \\cite{AiGym} The Atari environments in Open AI Gym use the Arcade Learning Environment. \\cite{AiGym}\\cite{ALE} Open AI Gym and the Arcade Learning Environment provide a useful way of accessing game data as input for a neural network. \\cite{AiGym}\\cite{ALE} We accessed only pixel data from this environment and not internal game states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\subsection*{Input Processing}\n",
    "We downconverted the images to 84x84 grayscale from a 210x160 rgb image in a similar manner to what was done by Mnih et al. for their DQN network. \\cite{HumLevCon} We threw away all but every 4th frame in process called frame skipping commonly used to decrease training time in video game playing agents. \\cite{HumLevCon} \\cite{PlayAtariDeep} We discretize the input by packaging four frames into the neural network's input data structure as discussed by Max Lapin in his Medium Article Speeding up DQN on PyTorch: how to solve Pong in 30 minutes. \\cite{SpeedDQN}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\subsection*{Topology of the Net and Loss Functions}\n",
    "Our neural net uses three convolutional layers to process visual features in the input pixels. They have a kernel of 8x8, 4x4, and 3x3 respectively. The net is then flattened out and two dense layers follow with 512 neurons and 3 neurons respectively. ReLU is used for all the layers except for the last which is linear. We use the huber loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\subsection*{Reinforcement Learning Algorithm}\n",
    "    We used a reinforcement learning approach to create our agent. This involved using DQN networks to approximate a $ Q^* $ function in a similar manner to Mnih et al.. \\cite{HumLevCon} Additionally, we employed an $\\epsilon$ greedy exploration approach. Our agent uses an offline learning method with replay memory in order to prevent catastrophic forgetting.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\\subsection*{Training}\n",
    "    We were able to train the agent for almost 82 hours (294661 seconds). This was well after $ \\epsilon $ reached its minimum during training. Because as $ \\epsilon $ approaches $ 0 $ the probability of choosing the action with the highest $ Q $ value increases, exploration had diminished by this point.\\cite{ReLer}"
